# Docker Images

<br>

Images play a major role within Docker, an image provides everything that is needed to create and start a container, which includes the daemon, the software libraries that it requires, configuration file scripts, etc, but before we download an image we must search for the image.

<br>

## Finding the right image
Search the Docker hub for images, in this case I will be downloading nginx.
```
sudo docker search nginx
```

- I will download the image with the highest rating

<br>

Download the following image
```
sudo docker pull nginx
```

<br>

Download a particular vesion of the image
```
sudo docker pull nginx:1.22.1
```
